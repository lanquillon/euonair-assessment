    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "Which modular design principle is demonstrated in the figure below?",
      "options": [
        "A) Modularity",
        "B) Placement of functions",
        "C) Abstraction",
        "D) Encapsulation"
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 0,
      "correct_answer_letter": "A",
      "bloom_level": "remember",
      "explanation": "The figure shows a modular design with separate modules for the different components of the system. This demonstrates the principle of modularity, which is to divide a large system into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "What is the main challenge in designing a user interface for a complex software system?",
      "options": [
        "A) Ensuring consistency of design elements",
        "B) Making the interface easy to use for users with disabilities",
        "C) Providing clear and concise instructions for each task",
        "D) Creating an aesthetically pleasing design"
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 3,
      "correct_answer_letter": "D",
      "bloom_level": "understand",
      "explanation": "The main challenge in designing a user interface for a complex software system is providing clear and concise instructions for each task. This is because the user must be able to quickly understand how to use the system without getting overwhelmed by too much information or confusion caused by poor instructional design."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Which technique can be used to improve the performance of a software system?",
      "options": [
        "A) Using caching to reduce database queries",
        "B) Implementing load balancing to distribute traffic",
        "C) Optimizing algorithms for faster execution",
        "D) Increasing the amount of memory available to the system"
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 2,
      "correct_answer_letter": "C",
      "bloom_level": "apply",
      "explanation": "Implementing load balancing can improve the performance of a software system by distributing traffic across multiple servers, reducing the load on any one server and improving overall response time. This is an example of the technique of load balancing, which can help to improve the performance of a software system."

      "question": "What is the main advantage of using a modular design in software engineering?",
      "options": [
        "A) Reducing the size of the source code",
        "B) Improving the maintainability of the system",
        "C) Increasing the readability of the code",
        "D) Decreasing the complexity of the system"

      "correct_answer_index": 1,
      "correct_answer_letter": "B",
      "bloom_level": "remember",
      "explanation": "The main advantage of using a modular design in software engineering is improving the maintainability of the system. Modular design allows for easier maintenance and updates by separating the system into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following is a principle of user-centered design?",
      "options": [
        "A) Creating an aesthetically pleasing design",
        "B) Providing clear and concise instructions for each task",
        "C) Ensuring consistency of design elements",

      "correct_answer_index": 2,
      "correct_answer_letter": "C",
      "bloom_level": "understand",
      "explanation": "The principle of user-centered design is ensuring that the design meets the needs and capabilities of the user. Providing clear and concise instructions for each task is an example of this principle, as it helps users to understand how to use the system without confusion or frustration."
