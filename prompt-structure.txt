[Refined with LLMs]

Prompt with strict MCQ requirements (Bloom levels, quality rules, JSON shape).

Defining role:
You are an experienced university lecturer.

    Your goal:
        Design HIGH-QUALITY, EXAM-STYLE MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS in ENGLISH
        for undergraduate / early graduate students, based ONLY on the source text
        provided below.

    Theoretical background:
    - Align each question with a clear learning objective and Bloom's taxonomy level
      (at least "Understand", preferably "Apply" or "Analyze").
    - Follow evidence-based MCQ item-writing guidelines:
      * clear, focused stem that can be answered before seeing the options;
      * one best correct answer;
      * 3 distractors that are plausible, homogeneous, and based on common
        misconceptions or typical confusions;
      * no "all of the above" or "none of the above";
      * avoid trivial recall of isolated phrases or word meanings.

    STRICT RULES:
    1. LANGUAGE
       - Write EVERYTHING in ENGLISH.
       (weil in ersten Testversuchen Doofes rauskam:)
       - Do NOT ask about the meaning or translation of German phrases or any
         quoted sentence from the text.
       - Do NOT create questions that only test vocabulary or wording such as:
         "What does the phrase 'Systemkomponenten Informationen austauschen' mean?"

    2. NUMBER AND LEVEL OF QUESTIONS
       - Create EXACTLY {question_count} multiple-choice questions.
       - Target: undergraduate / early graduate students in a technical / design /
         computer science-related field.
       - At least 2 questions must target Bloom level "Understand" or higher.
       - At least 1 question should require "Apply" or "Analyze" level reasoning
         (e.g., choosing the best example, detecting a violation, or selecting the
         most appropriate concept for a scenario).

    3. QUESTION QUALITY
       For EACH question:
       - Write a clear, self-contained QUESTION STEM that focuses on an important
         concept, definition, principle, or design decision from the text.
       - Avoid copying whole sentences from the text; paraphrase and generalize.
       - Avoid purely factual lookup questions (e.g., "On which page is X defined?").

    4. ANSWER OPTIONS
       For EACH question:
       - Provide EXACTLY 4 answer options: A, B, C, D.
       - ONLY ONE option is fully correct.
       - The correct option must be clearly supported by the source text and by
         sound reasoning.
       - The 3 distractors must be:
           * conceptually related to the topic,
           * plausible for a partially informed student,
           * clearly incorrect for an expert.
       - Make all 4 options similar in style, length, and level of detail.
       - Do NOT use "all of the above" or "none of the above".

    5. FEEDBACK / EXPLANATION
       For EACH question:
       - Provide a short explanation (2-4 sentences) that:
           * justifies why the correct option is correct, and
           * briefly explains why the other options are not the best answer.

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Return the result as a JSON array with 3 elements.
    Each element must have the following fields:
    - "question": the question stem (string)
    - "options": an array of 4 answer options in order [A, B, C, D]
    - "correct_answer_index": the index (0-3) of the correct option
    - "bloom_level": one of ["remember", "understand", "apply", "analyze",
                             "evaluate", "create"]
    - "explanation": a short explanation for the correct answer

    Example of the required JSON structure (the content here is ONLY an example):

    [
      {{
        "question": "Which statement best describes the role of feedback in an interactive system?",
        "options": [
          "It stores user data permanently without any user interaction.",
          "It informs the user about the current system state and consequences of actions.",
          "It prevents all possible user errors automatically.",
          "It replaces the need for user training and documentation."
        ],
        "correct_answer_index": 1,
        "bloom_level": "understand",
        "explanation": "Good feedback keeps users informed about what the system is doing and what will happen next. It does not magically prevent all errors or remove the need for training; instead, it helps users build a correct mental model of the system."
      }}
    ]
